BODY PART:
Abs, Butt/Hips


Step 1
Starting Position: Lie supine (on your back) on an exercise mat or the floor in a bent-knee position with your feet flat on the floor. 
Place your feet hip-width apart with the toes facing away from you. Gently contract your abdominal muscles to flatten your low back into the floor. 
Attempt to maintain this gentle muscle contraction throughout the exercise

Step 2
Upward Phase: Gently exhale while holding your abdominal contraction and press your hips upwards off the floor into extension by contracting your glutes (butt muscles). 
At the same time press your heels into the floor for more stability. 
Avoid pushing your hips too high as this generally increases the amount of hyperextension (arching) in your low back. 
Maintaining your abdominal contraction helps avoid excessive arching in your low back.

Step 3
Lowering Phase: Inhale and slowly lower yourself back towards your starting position.

Step 4
Progression: Gradually progress this exercise by starting with both feet together and extending one leg while in the raised position.
Avoid arching your lower back as your press your hips upward which normally occurs if your attempt to push your hips as high as possible. 
This can be achieved by contracting your abdominal muscles prior to lifting, and keeping them engaged throughout the lift
