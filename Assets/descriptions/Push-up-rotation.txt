BODY PART:
Arms, Chest, Abs, Shoulders

Step 1
Start in a plank position, with your shoulders over your wrists and legs out behind you with your feet hip distance apart. 
Pull your navel in and keep your back straight.

Step 2
As you lower and exhale, bend your elbows outward to the sides. 
Hold at the bottom for one breath.

Step 3
Raise back up to top push-up position. 
As you reach the top, keep moving in a fluid motion to side plank position: release your right arm and raise it to the ceiling, keeping your body in a long diagonal line. 
Hold for one breath, then move back into plank position.

Step 4
Repeat the push-up, twisting the opposite direction bringing your left arm toward the ceiling. 
Return to plank position to complete one rep.
