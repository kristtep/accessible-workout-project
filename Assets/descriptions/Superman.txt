Step 1
Starting Position: Lie prone (on your stomach) on a mat with your legs extended, ankles slightly plantarflexed (toes pointing away from your shins), arms extended overhead with palms facing each other. 
Relax your head to align it with your spine.

Step 2
Upward Phase: Exhale, contract your abdominal and core muscles to stabilize your spine and slowly extend both hips (raise both legs) a few inches off the floor while simultaneously raising both arms a few inches off the floor. 
Keep both legs and arms extended and avoiding any rotation in each. 
Maintain your head and torso position, avoiding any arching in your back or raising of your head. 
Hold this position briefly.

Step 3
Downward Phase: Gently inhale and lower your legs and arms back towards your starting position without any movement in your low back or hips.
