BODY PART:
Triceps


Find a stable chair, bench, or step.

Step 1
Sit on the edge of the chair and grip the edge next to your hips. 
Your fingers should be pointed at your feet. 
Your legs are extended and your feet should be about hip-width apart with the heels touching the ground. 
Look straight ahead with your chin up.

Step 2
Press into your palms to lift your body and slide forward just far enough that your behind clears the edge of the chair.

Step 3
Lower yourself until your elbows are bent between 45 and 90 degrees.

Step 4
Slowly push yourself back up to the start position and repeat. 
Control the movement throughout the range of motion.

Step 5
Begin with 3 sets of 10 repetitions and increase your sets and reps over several weeks as you build muscle and strength in your triceps.
