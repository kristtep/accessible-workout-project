Abs, Butt/Hips


Step 1
Starting Position: Lie on your right side on an exercise mat with extended legs, placing your left leg directly over your right leg and and stacking your feet one on top of the other. 
Place your right elbow directly under your shoulder, align your head with your spine and keep your hips and right knee in contact with the exercise mat.

Step 2
Upward Phase: Exhale, gently contract your abdominal / core muscles to stiffen your spine and lift your hips and knees off the mat, keeping contact with the side of your right foot and keep head aligned with your spine. 
Keep your right elbow positioned directly under your shoulder.

Step 3
Lowering Phase: Inhale and gently return yourself to your starting position. Alternate sides and repeat.

Step 4
Exercise Variation: You can increase the intensity of this exercise by (1) increasing the length of time you are in the raised position, (2) raising the upper leg off the lower leg or (3) raising the lower leg off the floor and maintaining contact with your elbow and the foot of the upper leg only.
When raising the upper leg off the lower leg, there is no need to raise it to a level beyond parallel with the floor.
